# Simple-Random-Number-Generator
This is just a pretty basic random number generator. The most complicated thing is probably the while loop which is still pretty simple
so this is good for a beginner.

Change the variables to change the random numbers generated and how many get generated.

If you want to change the numbers from integers to other numbers then you can just change randint to random.
